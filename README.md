# Project: Best Gym Ever.

### Description
I am in my first year of the Java Developer program at Nackademin. This is the second assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming course.

### Task
The gym “Best Gym Ever” has a problem. Their data system has crashed and cannot be used. The consultant who built the system is away and cannot come to fix it for several months. In addition, someone has posted online that Best Gym Ever’s system is 
broken and that everyone can come there to train for free, which has caused quite a few shady characters to show up.

Now the receptionist is asking you for help. They have managed to export a membership list from an Excel file that keeps track of all the members. However, not all the people in the list are current members. The receptionist wonders if you can write a 
program where one enters a customer’s personal ID number or name when the person shows up at the gym. The program should then search the data from the file and print out which of the following categories the customer belongs to:
- The customer is a current member (this is determined if the annual fee was paid less than a year ago). In this case, we also want to see what type of membership the customer has (Gold, Platinum, or Standard).
- The customer is a former member (if the annual fee was paid more than a year ago).
- The person is not in the file and therefore has never been a member and is unauthorized.
